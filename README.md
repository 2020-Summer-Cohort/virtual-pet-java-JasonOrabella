# Virtual Pet

I created a virtual pet, however I made it an aquarium instead of another pet.
I have a degree in fisheries science, and enjoy keeping fish.

This program allows the user to interact with the aquarium by doing a water change, feeding the fish, scrubbing algae,
admiring the fish, or quitting out of the game.

Water change lowers the nutrient levels for both phosphate or nitrate, as in a non virtual tank they would be adding new water with less nutrients.

Feeding the fish reduces hunger, however it increase nitrate and phosphate, as your fish would produce waste.

Scrubbing algae only modifies the algae level.

And admiring the fish doesn't do anything besides progress time.

Quitting out of the game leaves the game.
